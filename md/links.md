Since I no longer frequent social media sites, but still feel the urge to share things I find cool, I decided to make a list here, of the coolest things I come across on the web :)

## Programming 
[The beginners' guide to Redcode](http://vyznev.net/corewar/guide.html)

Let's start this section with a page I've been meaning to read for ever. It describes the idea of having a battle between assembly programs in a computer core (a stretch of empty instructions, except for the programs). The goal of each program is to take over the core, and kill the others in the process...

## MathLife
I've always been fascinated with emergence. [It's pretty easy to get lost in](https://imgur.com/a/ISWvQqA) (link of when I wasted two weeks on expanding on a bullet targeting algorithm that I wrote for a friend's game). The most awesome applications of emergence though, is when people actively try to one-up Conway's game of life. These things I call MathLife, and if you find any cool projects on this, be sure to let me know!

> "How life emerges from a simple particle motion law: Introducing the Primordial Particle Systems
Self-structuring patterns can be observed all over the universe, from galaxies to molecules to living matter, yet their emergence is waiting for full understanding. We discovered a simple motion law for moving and interacting self-propelled particles leading to a self-structuring, self-reproducing and selfsustaining life-like system. The patterns emerging within this system resemble patterns found in living organisms. The emergent cells we found show a distinct life cycle and even create their own ecosystem from scratch." 

- [Lenia – Mathematical Life Forms](https://vimeo.com/277328815)
> "Lenia (from Latin lenis, “smooth”) is a cellular automaton, like Conway’s Game of Life, but with continuous states and continuous space-time. It supports a great diversity of complex autonomous patterns or "lifeforms" bearing resemblance to real-world microscopic organisms. More than 400 species in 18 families have been identified, many discovered via interactive evolutionary computation."
