I just made this page, so there's not much here yet. Most of my projects, you can find in the [coding section](http://www.dwrolvink.com/?view=coding) on this website.

## Printing Gutenberg .txt formatted books

I was looking up some G.K. Chesterton books at my local library's website.
I heard some good things about his essays, and before buying a book, I wanted to see if I'd like his style.
While on the website, I found a book that seemed interesting, but it was no longer in print, so I couldn't buy it.
(I read mostly on the train, and I could take months to finish a book, so I don't want to be hurried when reading one from the library).

Turned out that the library's website had a link to the Gutenberg project's website. The book it provided was in .txt format though.
[On this page](https://github.com/dwrolvink/Linux/blob/master/Random/printing_gutenberg_txt.md), I'll show you my method for translating the .txt to a pdf booklet, which I printed and bound. Perhaps I'll add some pictures at a later time.



## The Ogame Worm

When I was still a small fry, I'd spend entire summer holidays behind the computer making "GFX" with my buds at the Dutch Ogame forum. One of the things we did there was make a worm. 

To make a worm, one person makes an image, and the next person will have to make an image that fits next to that one, and so on.

I recently recovered the backup of the website on an old USB drive, and decided to rehost it. 

You can find it here: [Ogame Worm II](http://worm.dwrolvink.com).
