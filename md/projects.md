I just made this page, so there's not much here yet. Most of my projects, you can find in the [coding section](http://www.dwrolvink.com/?view=coding) on this website.

## The Ogame Worm

When I was still a small fry, I'd spend entire summer holidays behind the computer making "GFX" with my buds at the Dutch Ogame forum. One of the things we did there was make a worm. 

To make a worm, one person makes an image, and the next person will have to make an image that fits next to that one, and so on.

I recently recovered the backup of the website on an old USB drive, and decided to rehost it. 

You can find it here: [Ogame Worm II](http://worm.dwrolvink.com).
